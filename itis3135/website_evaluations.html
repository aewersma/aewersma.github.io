        <h2>Evaluations:</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a></h3>
            <p>The website chosen for the 'good website' category is the homepage of the popular website building company, Wix. Their homepage is clean, orderly, and consists of a constant theme and layout to help advertise the website building tool they offer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Great contrast with text that stands out, but not too much. Great use of colour coding for different parts of what they offer.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Good use of consistent fonts and sections, button styles, and colours throughout.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Each section has their own structure being unique from the other sections, eyecatching, yet still distinct. Each section is ordered from top to bottom neatly, and it is not too cluttered.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Each related use case of their product has its own section with other elements, like a good chunk of the page dedicated to AI consists of different sections grouped together.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.savehighrocklake.org/hrinfo1.asp" target="_blank">Save High Rock Lake</a></h3>
            <p>The website chosen for the 'bad website' category is savehighrocklake.org, which seems to be a local organization hosting the website aiming to give information to visiters and locals of the lake. It is still being updated to this day, despite looking very dated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Contrast is alright, though it varies throughout. For example, hovering over the home button creates a yellow highlight but with white text. Some text is also very small and hard to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is at least two consistent fonts throughout the website, though one is Comic Sans. Spacing is inconsistent though between blocks of text. The entire website is skewed to the left too, leaving a lot of blank white space on the right.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> No clear alignment, as text and images seem randomly placed.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Content is crammed together with little spacing, making it very hard to differentiate sections. Is also very information dense, which doesn't help the readability.</li>
            </ul>
